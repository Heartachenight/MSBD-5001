Introduction:

1. I use file `GenerateTrain.py` to re-generate a new training data file `train1.csv`, from the original `train.csv`, for the later model training.
2. I use file `GenerateTest.py` to re-generate a new training data file `test1.csv`, from the original `test.csv`, for the later model training.
3. Then use file `Test.ipynb` to train model and generate the final `submission.csv`.
